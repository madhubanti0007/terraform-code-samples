Download terraform based on your OS configuration. <br/>

**Step 6:** **Click on "User variables" for your account and then select Path and click on Edit** <br/>
Then click on "new" <br/>
Add Path to your Terraform folder - which you accomplished in Step 2. <br/>
In my case I added <br/>
C:\Users\madhu\Terraform <br/>

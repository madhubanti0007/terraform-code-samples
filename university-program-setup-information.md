Download terraform based on your OS configuration. <br/>

Below I have stated example from Windows OS. <br/>

**Step 2:** **Create a folder in your C: drive. Name the folder as "Terraform"** <br/>
In my case I have it under: <br/>
C:\Users\madhu\Terraform <br/>

**Step 3:** **Unzip the .zip file you downloaded in step 1 and copy terraform.exe file inside the Terraform folder you created in step 2** <br/>

**Step 4:** **Now download and install Visual Studio Code** <br/>

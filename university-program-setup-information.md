**Step 1:** **Install terraform as per below guideline**
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install <br/>
Download terraform based on your OS configuration. <br/>

Below I have stated example from Windows OS. <br/>

**Step 2:** **Create a folder in your C: drive. Name the folder as "Terraform"** <br/>
In my case I have it under: <br/>
C:\Users\madhu\Terraform <br/>

**Step 3:** **Unzip the .zip file you downloaded in step 1 and copy terraform.exe file inside the Terraform folder you created in step 2** <br/>

**Step 4:** **Now download and install Visual Studio Code** <br/>

**Step 6:** **Click on "User variables" for your account and then select Path and click on Edit** <br/>
Then click on "new" <br/>
Add Path to your Terraform folder - which you accomplished in Step 2. <br/>
In my case I added <br/>
C:\Users\madhu\Terraform <br/>

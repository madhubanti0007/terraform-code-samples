# terraform-code-smaples
It is a repo where I keep uploading terraform code samples

**code sample 1:** [terraform-countvsforeach](https://github.com/madhubanti0007/terraform-code-samples/blob/master/terraform-countvsforeach/README.md) <br/>
               This code sample demonstrates the differences between count and for_each meta arguments in Terraform. <br/>

**code sample 2:** [Native test support by terraform](https://github.com/madhubanti0007/terraform-code-samples/blob/master/terraform-test/README.md) <br/>
               This code sample demonstrates the native "terraform test" support provided by Terraform for testing Terraform iac config. <br/>

**code sample 3:** [terraform state file in Azure storage account](https://github.com/madhubanti0007/terraform-code-samples/blob/master/terraform-remote-storage/README.md) <br/>
                   This code sample demonstrates how to store terraform-remote-state in Azure storage account and access it using Azure AD. <br/>
                   It also shows how to provision resources by updating remote state - for that refer here: <br/>

**code sample 4:** [terraform-data-source](https://github.com/madhubanti0007/terraform-code-samples/blob/master/terraform-data-source/README.md)<br/>
                   This code sample demonstrates how you can access a non-terraform provisioned cloud resource using Terraform data source. <br/>

**code sample 5:** [terraform-remote-state-data-source](https://github.com/madhubanti0007/terraform-code-samples/blob/master/terraform-remote-state-data-source/README.md) <br/>
                   This code sample demonstrates how you can access a Terraform provisioned cloud resource (which is done using this related project [terraform-remote-state-resource-group](https://github.com/madhubanti0007/terraform-code-samples/blob/master/terraform-remote-state-resource-group/README.md) using terraform_remote_state data source. <br/>

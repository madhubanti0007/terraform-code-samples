# terraform-code-smaples
It is a repo where I keep uploading terraform code samples

**code sample 1:** [terraform-countvsforeach](https://github.com/madhubanti0007/terraform-code-samples/tree/master/terraform-countvsforeach) <br/>
               This code sample demonstrates the differences between count and for_each meta arguments in Terraform. <br/>

**code sample 2:** [Native test support by terraform](https://github.com/madhubanti0007/terraform-code-samples/tree/master/terraform-test) <br/>
               This code sample demonstrates the native "terraform test" support provided by Terraform for testing Terraform iac config. <br/>
